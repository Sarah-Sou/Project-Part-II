# INFR3120 – Fall 2025 Project Part 1  
## Student Habit Tracker

This project is my Part 1 submission for INFR3120 (Web & Script Programming).  
I decided to build a simple Student Habit Tracker that lets users create habits, view them, update them, and delete them. It’s a basic CRUD web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with LocalStorage, but it represents the main idea of how habits can be tracked in a clean and easy way.

### What the site can do
- Add a new habit  
- View habit details  
- Edit a habit  
- Delete a habit  
- Show all habits on the main page in a table  

### How it works
All the data is stored in the browser using LocalStorage. No backend or server is required for this release since Part 1 only needs basic functionality. The goal was to show that the CRUD operations work properly and the pages connect to each other.

### Project Files
- `index.html` – Home page and habit list  
- `create.html` – Form to add a habit  
- `edit.html` – Edit habit form  
- `view.html` – Habit details page  
- `script.js` – All CRUD logic  
- `style.css` – Simple styling  
- PDF document for Part 1 is included  

### Group Members
Each person in the group contributed to different parts of the project.  
(Our group breakdown is included in the PDF.)
